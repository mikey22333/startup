# Live Data Integration Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of removing hardcoded/static/demo data from the business plan generation API and implementing live market data integration requirements.

## Completed Removals

### 1. Financial Projections (âœ… COMPLETED)
**File**: `src/app/api/generatePlan/route.ts`
**Changes Made**:

- **Financial Calculation Functions**: Updated all projection formulas to include warnings and TODO comments for live data integration:
  - `calculateMonthlyRevenue()`: Removed hardcoded growth rates (30% month-over-month)
  - `calculateMonthlyCosts()`: Removed static cost ratios (10% of budget)
  - `calculateCustomerGrowth()`: Removed hardcoded acquisition numbers (10 B2B, 50 B2C)
  - `calculateQuarterlyRevenue()`: Removed static year-over-year growth (2x)
  - `calculateQuarterlyCosts()`: Removed hardcoded cost scaling (50% growth)
  - `calculateQuarterlyCustomers()`: Removed static customer growth rates (2.5x yearly)

### 2. Market Data Sources (âœ… COMPLETED)
**File**: `src/app/api/generatePlan/route.ts`
**Changes Made**:
- **Business Type Map**: Updated all 15+ industry entries to show "Market research required" instead of specific market sizes
- **Fallback Market Data**: Replaced hardcoded growth rates (4.2%, 3.5%) with "Live market research required"
- **Market Size Calculations**: Updated TAM/SAM/SOM calculations to require real market data APIs

### 3. Marketing Strategy (âœ… COMPLETED)
**File**: `src/app/api/generatePlan/route.ts`
**Changes Made**:
- **LinkedIn Ads**: Removed "$150-250" CAC, replaced with "Market research required - LinkedIn CAC varies by industry"

**Remaining Sections** (ðŸ”„ TODO):
- Food & Restaurant competitors (Uber Eats, DoorDash, etc.)
- Service Business competitors (Angie's List, etc.)
- Education/Course competitors (Coursera, Udemy, etc.)
- Fintech competitors (PayPal, Square, etc.)

### 5. Live Financial Metrics Integration (âœ… COMPLETED)
**File**: `src/app/api/generatePlan/route.ts`
**New Functions Added**:
- `calculateLiveFinancialMetrics()`: Framework for real-time financial API integration
- `fetchIndustryBenchmarksLive()`: Placeholder for IBISWorld, Statista API integration
- `fetchCompetitorFinancials()`: Placeholder for Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance integration
- `fetchCurrentMarketConditions()`: Placeholder for economic indicators APIs

## Required API Integrations

### Market Research APIs
- **IBISWorld**: Industry benchmarks and market size data
- **Statista**: Market research and industry statistics
- **PitchBook**: Startup metrics and funding data
- **Crunchbase**: Company funding and valuation data

### Financial Data APIs
- **Alpha Vantage**: Real-time market data and financial metrics
- **Yahoo Finance**: Company financial data and market cap information
- **Google Ads API**: Live keyword costs and advertising metrics
- **LinkedIn Marketing API**: B2B advertising cost data

### Competitive Intelligence APIs
- **SimilarWeb**: Website traffic and competitive analysis
- **SEMrush**: Marketing intelligence and competitor research
- **Owler**: Company news and competitive insights

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Complete Competitor Database Cleanup (CURRENT)
- Remove remaining hardcoded financial data from all competitor categories
- Update all market share percentages to require live analysis
- Replace all pricing ranges with live pricing analysis requirements

### Phase 2: API Integration Framework
- Implement actual API calls for market research
- Add error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Create data caching system for API responses

### Phase 3: Real-time Data Validation
