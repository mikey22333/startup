# Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) in PlanSpark

## Overview

Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) is a **critical component** of PlanSpark that provides **real-time market intelligence** and **supplemental business research** to enhance the AI-generated business plans with current, factual data.

## What is Google CSE?

Google Custom Search Engine is a service that allows you to:
- **Search specific websites** or the entire web
- **Get current market data** from authoritative sources
- **Access real-time information** about industries, competitors, and trends
- **Enhance AI responses** with factual, up-to-date content

## How PlanSpark Uses Google CSE

### **1. Market Research Enhancement**

When a user generates a business plan, Google CSE performs **6 targeted searches**:

```typescript
// Step 4: Supplemental market research via Google CSE
const marketResearch = await Promise.allSettled([
  searchGoogle(`${idea} market size 2025 TAM SAM`),           // Market sizing
  searchGoogle(`${idea} competitors analysis pricing features`), // Competitor intel
  searchGoogle(`${idea} industry trends growth forecast 2025`),  // Growth trends  
  searchGoogle(`${businessType} business startup requirements ${location}`), // Regulatory info
  searchGoogle(`${businessType} funding investments venture capital trends`), // Funding data
  searchGoogle(`${businessType} regulatory compliance requirements ${location}`) // Compliance
])
```

### **2. Real-Time Data Integration**

The search results are integrated into multiple sections of the business plan:

#### **Market Analysis Section:**
```

### **3. Enhanced Business Plan Sections**
