### Method 3: Crowdsource (Ongoing)
- Add "Suggest Edit" feature to your app
- Users report incorrect/missing data
- Build database over time with user feedback

## 📊 **Data Quality Framework**

### Mark as "VERIFIED" only if:

- ✅ Published research with methodology
- ✅ Legal requirements from official sources

### Mark as "ESTIMATED" if:
- ⚠️ Aggregated from multiple sources
- ⚠️ Business advice websites
- ⚠️ General "rule of thumb" data

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Efficient Data Collection**

### Start with High-Impact Industries:
1. **Food & Restaurant** (most regulated, good data available)
2. **E-commerce** (well-documented, many resources)  
3. **Professional Services** (licensing varies by state)
4. **Fitness/Wellness** (health dept regulations)
5. **Technology/Software** (fewer regulations, focus on costs)

### Focus on High-Value Data Points:
1. **Legal requirements** - Most important for user trust
2. **Startup cost ranges** - Users want realistic budgets
3. **Common tools** - Actionable recommendations
4. **Location-specific data** - Critical for accuracy

### Batch Collection Strategy:
- Pick 2-3 industries per week
