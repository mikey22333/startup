# Live Market Data Integration Options

## Current Status
- TAM/SAM/SOM is AI-generated based on business context
- Data changes per business plan but isn't live/real-time
- Values are contextually relevant but not from live market databases

## Option 1: Market Research APIs (Recommended)
```typescript
// Integration with market research providers
const marketDataSources = {
  primary: 'Statista API',
  secondary: 'IBISWorld API', 
  tertiary: 'Market Research Future API'
}

// Example implementation
async function getLiveMarketSize(industry: string, region: string) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.statista.com/market-size/${industry}`)
  return {
    TAM: response.totalAddressableMarket,
    SAM: response.serviceableAddressableMarket,
    SOM: calculateSOM(response.data, businessModel)
  }
}
```

## Option 2: Financial Data APIs
```typescript
// Bloomberg, Reuters, or Alpha Vantage for public market data
const financialAPIs = {
  bloomberg: 'Real-time market cap data',
  alphavantage: 'Industry performance metrics',
  quandl: 'Economic indicators'
}
```

## Option 3: Government Data Sources
```typescript
// Free but less comprehensive
const governmentSources = {
  census: 'US Census Bureau Business Data',
  sba: 'Small Business Administration Stats',
  bea: 'Bureau of Economic Analysis'
}
```

## Cost Considerations
- **Statista API**: $500-2000/month for market data
- **IBISWorld**: $1000-5000/month for industry reports
- **Bloomberg Terminal**: $2000+/month for comprehensive data
- **Government APIs**: Free but limited scope

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with free government APIs for basic validation
2. Add premium APIs for specific high-value industries
3. Cache results to minimize API costs
4. Update data weekly/monthly rather than real-time

## Current AI Approach Benefits

✅ Always available data
✅ Contextually relevant to specific business
✅ Covers any industry/niche
✅ Fast response times

## Live Data Benefits
✅ Real market validation
✅ Investor-grade accuracy
✅ Current market conditions
