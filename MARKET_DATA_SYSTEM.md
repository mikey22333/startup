# 🚀 Auto-Updating Market Data System

Your business plan generator now features an **intelligent market data system** that automatically fetches and updates real-time market intelligence instead of using hardcoded numbers.

## 🎯 System Overview

### What It Does
- **Auto-detects industry** from business ideas
- **Fetches live market data** from multiple reliable sources  
- **Updates market intelligence** on a schedule and on-demand
- **Caches results** for fast response times
- **Provides structured insights** to AI for better business plans

### Data Sources Integration
| Source | Type | Data Provided | Status |
|--------|------|---------------|--------|
| Google Custom Search | API | Market size, trends, competitors | ✅ Active |
| World Bank Open Data | API | Economic indicators, regional data | ✅ Active |  
| RapidAPI Marketplace | API | Premium industry reports | 🔶 Optional |
| Verified Database | Internal | Legal requirements, costs, tools | ✅ Active |

## 🔄 How Auto-Updates Work

### 1. Scheduled Updates (Background)
```bash
# Vercel Cron (vercel.json)
Daily at 8 AM UTC → /api/market-data

# GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/update-market-data.yml)  
Every 6 hours → Calls your deployment API
```

### 2. On-Demand Updates (Real-time)
- When users generate business plans → High-priority industry update
- Admin dashboard manual triggers → Force refresh specific industries
- API endpoint calls → Programmatic updates

### 3. Smart Caching Strategy
- **Memory Cache**: 24-hour TTL for frequently accessed data
- **Database Storage**: Persistent storage with reliability tracking
- **Freshness Check**: Auto-refresh data older than 7 days

## 📊 Market Intelligence Features

### Industry Detection Algorithm
```typescript
// Input: "I want to start a food delivery app"
// Output: "Technology" + "Food & Restaurant" 
detectIndustry(businessIdea) // → Enhanced categorization
```

### Live Market Data Structure
```typescript
interface IndustryTrend {
  industry: string
  marketSize: {
    current: "$11.7B"          // Real current size
    projected: "$30B by 2032"  // AI-parsed projections
    cagr: "14%"               // Growth rate
    year: 2024
  }
  competitors: [
    { name: "UberEats", marketShare: "25%", strengths: [...] }
  ]
  trends: ["Mobile-first ordering", "Ghost kitchens rising"]
  opportunities: ["Underserved suburban markets"]
  lastUpdated: Date
}
```

### Enhanced AI Prompts
Instead of static prompts like:
```
"The fitness industry is worth $96 billion..."
```

Your AI now receives:
```
CURRENT MARKET INTELLIGENCE (Dec 15, 2024): 
Market Size: $11.7B | Growth: 14% CAGR |
