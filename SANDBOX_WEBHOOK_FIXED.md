# ✅ Sandbox Webhook Deactivated - Testing Guide

## 🎉 Issue Resolved!

You deactivated the sandbox webhook. This was causing transactions to route to sandbox even with production configuration.

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache Completely

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "All time"
3. Check:
   - ✅ Cookies and other site data
   - ✅ Cached images and files
4. Click "Clear data"

**Firefox:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Everything"
3. Check all boxes
4. Click "Clear Now"

### Step 2: Test in Incognito Mode

1. Open new incognito/private window
2. Go to: https://planspark.onrender.com/pricing
3. Click "Get Started" on any plan
4. Use a **real credit card** (not test card)
5. Complete the payment

### Step 3: Verify Transaction Location

**Production Dashboard (Should appear here):**
- URL: https://vendors.paddle.com/transactions
- Look for your test transaction
- Customer email should be correct
- No "TEST MODE" label

**Sandbox Dashboard (Should NOT appear here):**
- URL: https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/transactions
- Should see NO new transactions
- Only old test transactions

### Step 4: Check Webhook Logs on Render

Go to your Render dashboard and check logs:

**Expected logs:**
```
🎣 Paddle webhook received
✅ Paddle webhook signature verified
🎯 Processing Paddle webhook event: transaction.completed
✅ Webhook processing completed successfully
```

**Check webhook data:**
- Environment should be production
- Customer email should be the actual customer's email
- Transaction ID should be production format

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

## 📧 For Your Previous Customer

The customer who already paid through sandbox:

**Option 1: Refund & Re-subscribe**
1. Refund their sandbox transaction:
   - Go to: https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/transactions
   - Find their transaction
   - Issue refund
2. Email them:
   ```
   Hi [Customer],
   
   We had a technical issue with our payment system that has now been resolved.
   We've refunded your previous payment.
   
   Please re-subscribe at: https://planspark.onrender.com/pricing
   
   Your payment will now be processed correctly through our production system.
   
   Sorry for the inconvenience!
   ```

**Option 2: Manual Grant (Quicker)**
1. Keep their sandbox subscription active
2. Manually update your database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles 
   SET subscription_tier = 'pro' -- or 'pro+'
   WHERE email = 'customer@email.com';
   ```
3. Let sandbox subscription continue (it still works)
4. Monitor sandbox dashboard just for this customer
