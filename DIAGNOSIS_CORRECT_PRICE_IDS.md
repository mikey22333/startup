# üîç Real Credit Card + Correct Price IDs = Still Going to Sandbox?

## Diagnosis: If Price IDs Are Correct

If you've verified that your price IDs exist in **production** Paddle dashboard, then the issue is one of these:

## Most Likely Causes (In Order)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Webhook Configured in BOTH Sandbox and Production

**The Issue:**
- You have the same webhook URL in BOTH dashboards
- Sandbox webhook fires first or interferes
- Your server can't tell which environment sent it

**Check This:**

**Sandbox Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com
2. Developer Tools ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Look for: `https://planspark.onrender.com/api/paddle/webhook`
4. **If found:** DELETE IT immediately

**Production Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://vendors.paddle.com
2. Developer Tools ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Look for: `https://planspark.onrender.com/api/paddle/webhook`
4. **Should exist:** Keep this one, verify it's active

**Why This Matters:**
- If webhook exists in sandbox, transactions get logged there
- Your database updates happen from sandbox webhook
- Customer sees sandbox transaction ID

---

### 2. üîë Wrong Webhook Secret

**The Issue:**
- Your `PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is the SANDBOX secret
- Not the PRODUCTION secret

**Check This:**

Your current webhook secret:
```bash
PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=ntfset_01k4zg9mj3wcs53rj1bz4a8c29
```

**Verify this is production secret:**
1. Go to: https://vendors.paddle.com/notifications/webhooks
2. Click on your webhook
3. Copy the webhook secret
4. Compare with your environment variable
5. **If different:** Update environment variable

**Important:**
- Sandbox webhook secret ‚â† Production webhook secret
- They are different values for different environments
- Using sandbox secret = sandbox webhooks processed

---

### 3. üåê Browser Cache/Cookies from Previous Sandbox Testing

**The Issue:**
- Browser cached Paddle SDK in sandbox mode
- Old cookies directing to sandbox
- Previous session persisting

**The Fix:**

**Step 1: Complete Cache Clear**
```
1. Open browser settings
2. Privacy & Security ‚Üí Clear browsing data
3. Select "All time"
4. Check:
   - ‚úÖ Cookies and site data
   - ‚úÖ Cached images and files
   - ‚úÖ Site settings
5. Clear data
```

**Step 2: Test in Incognito**
```
1. Open new incognito/private window
2. Go to: https://planspark.onrender.com/pricing
3. Click "Get Started"
4. Complete purchase
```

**Step 3: Hard Refresh**
```
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

### 4. üìß Customer's Email Already in Sandbox

**The Issue:**
- Customer previously tested with their email in sandbox
- Paddle recognizes email and routes to sandbox account
- Email is "tied" to sandbox customer ID

**Check This:**

**Sandbox Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/customers
2. Search for customer's email
3. **If found:** This might be causing the issue

**Solutions:**

**Option A: Delete Sandbox Customer**
1. Find customer in sandbox dashboard
2. Delete the customer record
3. Ask customer to try again
4. Should create new customer in production

**Option B: Use Different Email**
1. Ask customer to use different email address
2. Will create fresh customer in production
3. No sandbox association

---

### 5. üîÑ Paddle API Key is Sandbox Key

**The Issue:**
- Your `PADDLE_API_KEY` is sandbox API key
- Used for server-side operations
- Might influence checkout behavior

**Check This:**

Your current API key:
```bash
PADDLE_API_KEY=pdl_live_apikey_01k50y5hvajfrp35aqkdcrv8yq_h2YnnxZzBJPnkNEkY4kxYg_AqM
```

**Verify:**
- Production API keys start with: `pdl_live_apikey_...` ‚úÖ
- Sandbox API keys start with: `pdl_test_apikey_...` ‚ùå

**Looks correct, but double-check:**
1. Go to: https://vendors.paddle.com/authentication
2. API Keys section
3. Verify your key matches

---

### 6. üé≠ Paddle Account Not Fully Activated

**The Issue:**
- Your Paddle production account is not fully verified
- Paddle defaults to sandbox for unverified accounts
- Need to complete verification

**Check This:**

1. Go to: https://vendors.paddle.com
2. Look for verification banners or notices
3. Check account status

**Required:**
- ‚úÖ Business information complete
- ‚úÖ Tax information submitted
- ‚úÖ Payout details configured
- ‚úÖ Account verified by Paddle

**Until verified:**
- Paddle might route to sandbox
- Even with correct configuration

## üî¨ Advanced Diagnostics

### Check Paddle Checkout URL in Browser Console

When checkout opens, check the console:

```javascript
// Look for these logs:
üöÄ Initializing Paddle in PRODUCTION mode
‚úÖ Price preview successful

// Check the checkout URL that opens
// Should contain: vendors.paddle.com
// Should NOT contain: sandbox-vendors.paddle.com
```

### Check Network Tab

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Click "Get Started" to open checkout
4. Look for requests to:
   - ‚úÖ `vendors.paddle.com` = Production ‚úÖ
   - ‚ùå `sandbox.paddle.com` = Sandbox ‚ùå

### Check Paddle Checkout HTML

When checkout opens:
1. Right-click on checkout overlay
2. Inspect element
3. Look for data attributes or URLs
4. Should reference production, not sandbox

## üéØ Most Likely Answer

Based on your situation (real card + correct price IDs), the issue is **99% likely**:

### **Webhook configured in sandbox dashboard**

**Why:**
1. Your code is correct (production mode)
2. Price IDs are correct (production IDs)
3. Token is correct (live token)
4. But sandbox webhook is firing first
5. Your database gets updated with sandbox data
6. Transaction appears in sandbox dashboard

**The Fix:**
1. Delete webhook from sandbox dashboard
2. Keep only production webhook
3. Test again
4. Should work correctly
